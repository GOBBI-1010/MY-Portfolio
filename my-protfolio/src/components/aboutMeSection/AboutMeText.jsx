      <p>
      I'm a self-taught web developer with experience in designing new features from ideation to production, implementation of wireframes and design flows into high performance software applications. I take into consideration the user experience while writing reusable and efficient code. I passionately combine good design, technology, and innovation in all my projects, which I like to accompany from the first idea to release.
